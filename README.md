Home page:

## Work done
- The project is written in TypeScript
- How the collector was used Vite
- The application is fully responsive to mobile browsers
- Used technology stack (axios, vueuse, pinia, ue-i18n, vue-router, vuetify, sass)
- Added comments in some places in the code
- When working with components, the style recommendations of the documentation were taken into account
- Taking into account the requirements of the technical specifications and the inconsistency with the endpoint provided in the technical specifications,
I found the link https://api.npms.io/v2/ on the resource provided in the technical specifications and ask for the API

## Additional features not included in the technical specifications
